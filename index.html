                Recording your weight regularly
                is a powerful motivating tool. It
                can give you valuable feedback on how
                your weight-loss
                efforts are paying off and what's not working. Moreover, studies suggest that keeping track of your
                scale readings over
                time might help prevent you from gaining weight. Since your weight can fluctuate greatly from day to
                day, it's not
                important to weigh yourself daily-but some people find it easier to remember that way. Weighing once
                weekly is fine too.
